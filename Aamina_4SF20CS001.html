  East Molokai Volcano

  <p style="font-family: serif">
  The East Molokai Volcano, commonly known as Wailau (after Wailau Valley), has a quiet, beautiful area for walking. Over 70% of the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i is covered by this dormant volcano. Kamakou, its tallest peak, rises to a height of around 4,900 feet. The East Molokai Volcano is quite remote and rural, in contrast to several other volcano zones. Renting a car is the most effective way to get there. When you get there, you can go on a walk and discover beautiful places like waterfalls and lagoons.<br>

  <p>
  At Kailua Beach Park in Kailua is Kalama's, a lovely beach with a traditional tropical ambience and fine, fluffy white sand. The calm waves at Kalama make it a wonderful beach for beginner body boarders and surfers, and there aren't nearly as many people here as at Kailua, Kalama's adjacent beach.Because of the wind, kite boarders appreciate this location, and kids frequently play within the break. There are lots of places to find shade to avoid the heat. Given that they are separated by the same length of beach, Kailua and Kalama are reachable by foot. Also, they can both see the Mokulua islands. The gorgeous park has a picnic area, bathrooms, and showers but no lifeguards.<br>

  Maunawili Falls
  </h1>

  <p>
  Under the imposing Pali Cliffs, in the Maunawili Valley, is where you'll find Maunawili Waterfall. You can reach this nearby Oahu waterfall by taking a nice hiking track that climbs up the hillside and descends back down. The city and county have identified and are responsible for maintaining the challenging 2-mile Maunawili Waterfall Trail. But don't fool yourself; you will still need to hop rocks and walk across tree roots to cross streams. As you arrive to the trail's end, you'll discover a Hawaiian waterfall paradise playground where some daredevils jump over cliffs into pools of water in the mountains.<br>
